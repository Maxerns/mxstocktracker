## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Twilio account and phone number
- OpenAI API key
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) dependencies

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables (see `.env.example`):

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER=your_personal_phone_number
WEBHOOK_URL=your_twilio_webhook_url
```

> **Note:**  
> `WEBHOOK_URL` should be set to the exact public URL Twilio uses to POST to your `/receive-message` endpoint (e.g., your ngrok or production HTTPS URL).

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stock-tracker-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Project

### FastAPI Deployment

Run the agent as a web service using FastAPI and Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- The `/receive-message` endpoint processes incoming SMS messages from Twilio.
- The agent tracks stocks and sends alerts automatically.

### Twilio Setup

1. Set up your Twilio phone number and credentials in `.env`.
2. Configure Twilio to POST incoming SMS to your server's `/receive-message` endpoint.
3. Only messages from your `TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER` will be processed.
4. Make sure `WEBHOOK_URL` in your `.env` matches the public URL Twilio uses to reach your endpoint.

### SMS Commands

You can instruct the agent to manage your stock tracker list via plain text SMS command such as:

- **Add a stock**: e.g., `Start tracking AAPL`
- **Remove a stock**: e.g., `Stop tracking MSFT`
- **List tracked stocks**: e.g., `What stocks am I tracking?`
- **Get stock price**: e.g., `What is the price of AAPL?`

- The agent will confirm actions and update your tracker list.

### Test Mode

You can run the agent in test mode for local testing:

```bash
python main.py -test
```

- This starts a chat terminal for manual interaction and runs the stock tracker every minute.

To trigger a research pipeline for a specific stock:

```bash
python main.py -test -research <SYMBOL>
```

Example:
```bash
python main.py -test -research AAPL
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Build and Run

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t stock-tracker-agent .
   ```

2. Run with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env stock-tracker-agent
   ```

3. Or use Docker Compose (if you have a `docker-compose.yml`):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üìù How It Works

1. **Tracking**: The agent checks prices for stocks in your tracker list.
2. **Alerting**: If a stock moves >1% up or down from previous close, the agent:
   - Runs a research pipeline to analyze news and market events
   - Summarizes findings in under 160 characters
   - Sends an SMS alert to your phone
3. **Interaction**: You can add/remove stocks by sending SMS commands to the agent.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- Ensure your `.env` variables are correct and match your Twilio/OpenAI accounts.
- Check Twilio webhook configuration for correct endpoint and authentication.
- Make sure `WEBHOOK_URL` matches the public URL Twilio uses.
- Review logs for error details.
